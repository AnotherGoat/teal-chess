/**
 * A square is one of the 64 places where a piece can be found.
 * It's usually identified by its chess algebraic notation, which consists of the square's rank (a-h) folowed by its file (1-8).
 * Indexes are represented in Little-Endian Rank-File mapping (LERF).
 * <p>
 * This class is full of static constants, which contain the index of each square.
 * This is done to improve code readabilty (because it allows using static imports) and performance (because it avoids having to use {@code AlgebraicConverter} too often).
 * <p>
 * Note that these constants don't follow Java's code conventions.
 * Instead, they follow Chess conventions, where files are represented by lowercase letters.
 * <p>
 * Even if unused, none of these 64 constants should be deleted.
 * Feel free to use them in unit tests too!
