// TODO: Mention little-endian rank-file mapping
/**
 * A coordinate is one of the 64 places where a square can be found. It's usually identified by
 * the chess algebraic notation, which consists of the coordinate's rank (a-h) folowed by its file (1-8).
 * This class is full of static constants, which contain the index of each square.
 * This is done to improve readabilty and performance (avoids having to use AlgebraicConverter too often).
 * Even if unused, none of these 64 constants should be deleted. Feel free to use them in unit tests too!
