# TODO

The following features are planned but still in the works:

- Improve logging in general.
- Create unit tests for most of the chess engine.
- Add a confirmation warning when closing the game.
- Indicate which player's is the current turn.
- Add feedback when selecting a piece.
- Parse a text file to put the pieces on the board.

There are also many TODOs thrown around in the code, for specific implementation details.
