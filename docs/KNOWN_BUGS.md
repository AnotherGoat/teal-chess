# Known bugs

This is a list of known bugs that will be fixed before the first release:

- Sliding pieces aren't stopped by enemy pieces, for example the Queen.
- Some mechanics like castling and pawn promotions are unfinished.
- Checks and checkmates aren't handled correctly.
- Highlighted moves appear beside the target piece, not over it.
