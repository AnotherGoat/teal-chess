# Known bugs

This is a list of known bugs that will be fixed before the first release:

- Some mechanics like castling and pawn promotions are unfinished.
- Checks and checkmates aren't handled correctly.
- Highlighted moves appear beside the target piece, not over it.
- Castling works on white king-side but it takes the wrong rook on queen-side.
